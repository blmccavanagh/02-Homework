                    <p>I do many things.</p>
                    <p>I have been running my own Personal Training business for over 5 years, specialising in Exercise
                        for Mental Health Management.</p>
                    <p>I am currently studying at the University of Western Australia, undertaking their full stack
                        coding bootcamp. In the UK I studied across multiple disciplines at University of the Arts
                        London, the University of Glasgow and UCLan.</p>
                    <p>I like when things are right, don't we all? But the ability to not only identify, but solve the
                        problems we encounter is how we continue to learn and push to succeed.</p>
                    <p>I challenge the negative connotations that far too often come hand in hand with being a self
                        proclaimed perfectionist. I am zealously hardworking, permanently curious and aspire, above
                        anything else, to achieve exponential growth in all facets of my life as it evolves. Though I
                        may strive for perfection, I will always appreciate the value of the mistakes we make. Mistakes
                        keep us learning. They keep us nimble and creative and keep us focussed on expansion, not
                        stagnation.</p>
                    <p>Enough talk, the work below can say the rest.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in working with me, contact me <a href="#contact">here.</a></p>
